1. Upload the code to phoneGap to build and get the app.
2. -CSS/Suduku.css: the style page;
   -images:images folder
   -js: js folder
   -index.html-the main page.

Tech: Only got time to finish everything. 
      Didn’t use the engines, module loaders, and preprocessors. 
      Used jQuery a little. 
      Used Bootstrap for four buttons because the time is up.
      Used sketch to make the background pic glass blurred. But I can also use CSS…
Time: Almost all CSS and js code. Didn’t write much on weekends. So the total time should be one day. 

Mistakes: 
1. Bad Responsive Design: Didn’t read the email in detail at first. After finish Sudoku.js, I found I need to deal with responsive issue. But in the js file I created a lot of elements. So the easiest way I can do now is to revise CSS according to different window size. But that’s not the good choice because every time you changed the window size, you need to refresh the page to get the better view. Next time I need to calculate the size before writing the code…
2. Bad glass blur feature: Got no time so only made background pic blurred.
3. Didn’t think about user experience too much. This is a big deal.

Next time:
1. Design first.
2. Separate js and css.
3. Add a logo and make the page pretty and professional.
4. Test on different devices and revise the design.
